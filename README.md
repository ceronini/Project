## Business Activities

> [TALA](https://tala.co) is working to providing financing options to people who lack access to traditional lending options. These are usually people who may not have bank accounts and no credit history, and therefore will not even have access to loan options provided by traditional lending institutions. [TALA's](https://tala.co) business is focused on developing countries in East Africa and Southeast Asia. The company has also entered the Latin American sphere with an office in Mexico City. 

>***The World Bank*** estimate that about 68% of adults have no credit recorded anywhere and therefore no credit score. TALA uses a simple approach to solve a major problem. TALA's major competitive edge is being able to use non-traditional financial data from mobile phone use to analyse customer's potential to pay back loans. 

>A competitior in East Africa - *Branch International* provides microloans in emerging markets such as Tanzania and Kenya. However, TALA has started leveraging data to offer Insurance products. *TALA* estimates it's payback rate at **92%**, which shows their model is working well enough.

## TALA's Impact

*TALA* makes loan as low as $10 to people and so far made over $1 billion in loans to clients. Providing access to capital helps underserved customers build businesses and meet urgent financial needs that are in some instances life and death decisions. TALA is opening up financial markets in East Africa and Southeast Asia to rural and far flung communities, who may not a financial institution for miles, but have a mobile phone.

## Recommendations

An additiopnal product that the company should add to their portfolio is **Money Transfers**. Adding this service will allow gthe customers to transact business and make payments for purchases and services without having to go to a bank which may not be nearby. Money transfer will open up opportunities for the company to build on their success and reach even more clients.

Money transfer will require use of various programming languages. Python may be used to pull and analyses tons of data from sources to verify identity and financial profiles of customers requiring services to avoid fraud and money laundering.
